# Personal Website

This project started from a desire to create a portfolio website and turned into a personal project all on its own.

## Getting Started
1.  **Install the Angular CLI**

    ```sh
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server**

    ```sh
    ng serve --open
    ```

## Building for Production
The Angular CLI also gives you a simple way to create a production build with:

```sh
ng build --prod
```
